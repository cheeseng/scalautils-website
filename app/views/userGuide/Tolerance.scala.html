<h1>Tolerance</h1>

<p>
ScalaUtils also includes a <a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalautils.Tolerance">Tolerance</a> trait that enables checking tolerances of numeric types with a
<code>+-</code> symbolic operator in ScalaTest.  In addition to:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
result should be (2.0 +- 0.1)
</pre>

<p>
You can now also use Tolerance with ScalaTest <code>should equal</code>, <code>shouldEqual</code>, and <code>shouldBe</code> syntax:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
result should equal (2.0 +- 0.1)
result shouldEqual 2.0 +- 0.1
result shouldBe 2.0 +- 0.1
result should === (2.0 +- 0.1)
</pre>

<p>
Or just with plain-old <code>===</code>, in an assertion in tests or just as part of a Boolean expression in production code:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
// In tests:
assert(result === (3.0 +- 0.2))

// In production code:
if (result === (2.0 +- 0.1)) "close enough" else "sorry"
</pre>

</div>
