<p>
This user guide will help you get rolling quickly with ScalaUtils.  First a brief orientation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ScalaUtils focuses on useful aspects such as equality, normalization, tolerance etc. that may make sense to use in your production code as well as your tests.</li>
<li>The org.scalautils package is included in the ScalaTest jar, but is also available separately in a small ScalaUtils jar.</li>
<li>ScalaUtils will always be released alongside ScalaTest, with version numbers that match exactly. So when ScalaTest 2.1 is released, for example, ScalaUtils 2.1 will also be released.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, get started by understanding <a href="@routes.UserGuide.equality.url">Equality</a>.
