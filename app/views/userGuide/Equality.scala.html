        <h1>Equality</h1>

            <p>
                ScalaUtils allows you to customize what equality means for a type <code>T</code> by defining an <a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalautils.Equality">
                <code>Equality[T]</code></a> typeclass. This can be used with the <code>===</code> operator in production code and in tests, with ScalaTest assertions,
                the <code>should</code> <code>equal</code>, <code>shouldEqual</code>, and <code>should</code> <code>===</code> matcher syntax.
            </p>
