        <p>
            ScalaUtils is focused on aspects of equality, normalization, and tolerance that may make sense to use in your production code as well as your tests. The
            <code>org.scalautils</code> package is included in the ScalaTest jar, but is also available separately in a ScalaUtils jar. The idea is you can add a dependency
            on ScalaUtils in your production classpath, so you can use it in your production code without having ScalaTest on the classpath. You should never
            include ScalaTest in your production classpath, because when ScalaTest doesn't like something it tends to throw a <code>TestFailedException</code>. ScalaUtils will
            always be released alongside ScalaTest, with version numbers that match exactly. So when ScalaTest 2.1 is released, for example, ScalaUtils 2.1 will also be released.
