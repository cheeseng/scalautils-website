<h1>Writing JUnit and TestNG tests in Scala</h1>

<p>
One way to integrate ScalaTest with existing tools is to run your ScalaTest tests through JUnit.
With ScalaTest's <a href="/user_guide/using_junit_runner"><code>JUnitRunner</code> annotation</a>, you can run any ScalaTest <code>Suite</code> written
in any style with JUnit 4.
