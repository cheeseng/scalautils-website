<h1>ScalaUtils quick start</h1>

<p>
To get started with ScalaUtils, first make sure you have ScalaUtils setup by following guide in <a href="@routes.Application.download.url">Download</a>
</p>

<p>
If you have ScalaUtils Jar in your path, you could try it with Scala REPL:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
$ scala -cp scalautils_2.10-2.0.RC1.jar
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (...).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import org.scalautils.TripleEquals._
import org.scalautils.TripleEquals._

scala> 1 + 1 === 2
res2: Boolean = true

scala> 1 + 1 === 3
res3: Boolean = false
</pre>

Alternatively, if you have ScalaUtils added to your sbt project, you can try it with with its Scala console:

<pre class="scala">
sbt> console
[info] Starting scala interpreter...
[info]
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (...).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import org.scalautils.TripleEquals._
import org.scalautils.TripleEquals._

scala> 1 + 1 === 2
res0: Boolean = true

scala> 1 + 1 === 3
res1: Boolean = false
</pre>

<p>
You are off and running! For more information, consult the <a href="@routes.UserGuide.userGuideIndex">user guide</a>.
